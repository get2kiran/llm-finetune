# 🚀 Welcome to the "LLM Finetune" Repository! 🤖

In this repository, we focus on utilizing libraries such as `trl`, `peft`, and `transformers` to accomplish fine-tuning of models available on Hugging Face. Our goal is to enable users to fine-tune these models according to their specific needs and tasks. With powerful tools like reinforcement learning (`rl`), we aim to optimize the performance of models such as `LLM`, `LORA`, and `QWEN`.
